# E-commerce User Microservice

# Overview

This microservice is the heart of the e-commerce platform, responsible for managing user accounts and authentication. It provides endpoints for user registration, login, profile management, and deletion. Additionally, it handles crucial functionalities like JWT-based token authentication, user role management, and secure session management.
All authorization, tokenization, and validation are handled by this service, making it central to the security of the platform. Other services, such as Product, Order, and Payment, validate the token and user details by calling the client service provided by the User Service, ensuring seamless and secure communication across the platform.
This version emphasizes the importance of the User Service and its role in managing authentication and validation for other microservices.
